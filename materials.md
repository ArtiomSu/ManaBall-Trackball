The hot melt insert stuff above is optional because the friction fit is more than good enough for the sensor. If the sensor falls out for you, then you can secure it with the inserts and m2 screws.

The leds are also optional if you don't want the led lights for some reason, the firmware will still work without any leds attached since it doesn't really care if you have the pin connected or not, it will still send out the signal into thin air.
